## Technology Stack Decisions

*   **TypeScript Version**:
    *   **Decision**: Use the latest stable version of TypeScript (currently 5.3).
    *   **Rationale**: Using the latest version provides access to the newest features, improved type checking, and better editor support.
    *   **Alternatives considered**: Older versions were considered but rejected to avoid potential compatibility issues and to leverage modern language features.
*   **Node.js Version**:
    *   **Decision**: Use the latest Long-Term Support (LTS) version of Node.js (currently 20.x).
    *   **Rationale**: LTS versions provide a stable platform with long-term support, making them ideal for production environments.
    *   **Alternatives considered**: The latest "current" version was considered but rejected in favor of the stability and predictability of the LTS release.
*   **React Version**:
    *   **Decision**: The React version will be determined by the version of Payload CMS being used. The latest version of Payload CMS is v3.53.0, which uses React 18.x.
    *   **Rationale**: Tying the React version to Payload CMS ensures compatibility and avoids potential conflicts. Using the latest version of Payload CMS provides access to the latest features and security updates.
    *   **Alternatives considered**: Using a different version of React was considered but rejected to maintain compatibility with Payload CMS.
*   **Testing Framework**:
    *   **Decision**: Use Jest for both front-end and back-end testing.
    *   **Rationale**: Jest is a widely-used, well-documented, and feature-rich testing framework that works seamlessly with React and Node.js. It provides a consistent testing experience across the entire stack.
    *   **Alternatives considered**: Mocha and Chai were considered but Jest's all-in-one nature makes it a more convenient choice.

## Performance, Scalability, and Observability

*   **Performance Goals**:
    *   **Decision**: Target a Lighthouse performance score of 90+ for the front end. The back end should handle at least 100 requests per second.
    *   **Rationale**: These are standard performance targets for modern web applications and provide a good user experience.
*   **Scale/Scope**:
    *   **Decision**: The initial scope is to support up to 10,000 users and a library of up to 1,000 unique cards.
    *   **Rationale**: This provides a clear target for the initial implementation and infrastructure.
*   **Observability**:
    *   **Decision**: Implement structured logging using a library like Pino for the back end. For the front end, use LogRocket for session replay and error tracking, and send logs to the back end for unified analysis.
    *   **Rationale**: Structured logging provides a consistent and machine-readable format for logs, making them easier to search and analyze. LogRocket provides powerful session replay capabilities that can help debug front-end issues. Centralizing logs allows for a holistic view of the application's health.
