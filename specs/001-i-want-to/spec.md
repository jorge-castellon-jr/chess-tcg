# Feature Specification: Payload CMS TCG Website

## 1. Description

This document outlines the specifications for a new feature: a Payload CMS-powered website for a trading card game (TCG). The platform will serve as a central hub for all information related to the TCG, including cards, sets, rules, and tournament history. It will provide a rich user experience for deck building and sharing, with user authentication handled through Discord.

## 2. User Stories

- **As an admin,** I want to be able to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on all TCG-related data, including cards, sets, tournament history, and the rules/FAQ page. This will allow me to keep the website's content up-to-date.
- **As a user,** I want to be able to see a comprehensive list of all the cards available in the TCG, so I can explore the game's offerings.
- **As a user,** I want to be able to see which set each card was released in, so I can understand the context and legality of each card.
- **As a user,** I want to be able to view a history of past tournaments, so I can see which decks and players have been successful.
- **As a user,** I want to be able to access a dedicated page for the game's rules and frequently asked questions, so I can learn how to play and resolve common queries.
- **As a user,** I want to be able to build and share my own decks, so I can strategize and collaborate with other players.
- **As a user,** I want to be able to log in using my Discord account, so I can have a personalized experience and save my decks.
- **As a logged-in user,** I want to be able to save the decks I've built, so I can access them later.

## 3. Out of Scope

- **Real-time gameplay:** This feature will not include a playable version of the TCG.
- **User-to-user messaging or forums:** The platform will not support direct communication between users.
- **E-commerce:** The website will not be used for buying or selling cards.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- The Payload CMS must be fully configured and operational, with collections for cards, sets, tournament history, and a global for the rules/FAQ page.
- The front end of the website must display all cards and their respective sets.
- A deck builder interface must be available to all users.
- Users must be able to log in using Discord OAuth.
- Logged-in users must be able to save their decks to their account.
- A sharing mechanism must be in place to generate a unique, public-facing URL for each deck.
- The website must have dedicated pages for the rules, FAQ, and tournament history.

## 5. Dependencies

- **Payload CMS:** For the back-end content management.
- **Discord:** For user authentication.
- **Front-end framework:** A modern JavaScript framework like React or Vue will be used to build the user interface.
- **Database:** A database compatible with Payload, such as MongoDB or PostgreSQL, will be required to store the data.
